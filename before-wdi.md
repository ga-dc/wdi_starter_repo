### Important!

**Please complete the following steps as soon as possible.** We can't make classroom/squad assignments until you do!

1. **Click [this link](https://garnet.wdidc.org/github/authorize?invite_code=a5d4bd0222d19c66a146d4b225f8e3ea).** This will authorize you for Garnet, an application that both instructors and students will use to track your progress throughout WDI.  

2. **Update your GitHub profile with your full name and profile picture.** The latter is very important - we need to know what you look like! The clearer the picture, the better.

Once you're done, we encourage you to take a look through [this readme](https://github.com/ga-dc/wdi12/blob/master/readme.md) if you would like to learn more about what you can expect out of WDI.

See you all at orientation!
