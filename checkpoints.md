# Checkpoints

Here's a list of need to know concepts covered in each of the various weeks. Each week, we'll compile a list of everything we absolutely need to know moving forward as web developers. That is not to say that everything else we cover in class isn't important, but the things listed here are the absolute minimum requirements in order to be successful. If you find yourself looking over past weeks and are forgetting or misremembering a concept, you are highly encouraged to make sure to understand them throughout the entirety of the course(and as a developer).
